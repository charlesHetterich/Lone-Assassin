#Lone Assassin
######January 2015

Lone Assassin was the first game I made using OpenGL directly instead of SDL for graphics. It was also the first game I spent a lot of time working on the art and the fist game that I used subclasses in. It was great practice for me with subclasses. I learned about them when I was studying for the Computer Science AP so I wanted to get as much use out of them as possible. And I'm not sure if this is a bad thing, but I also started writting a lot of code just in header files with a lot of different subclasses.

This is my most completed game. I made it for a [warm up Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/minild-56/?action=preview&uid=48906). It was very successful for me in that it was the closest I've ever been to a game that is completed from beginning to end, and I was able to make a relatively larger project in about a week. I've never had many experiences actually giving my projects to the public, so making the game playable on other computers was very shakey. The users had to install the Visual Studio redistributables and Google Chrome saw it as malware.
